Acknowledgements
We thank all students, educators, and community members who provided guidance, feedback, and inspiration during the conceptualization of this project. Their support and insights were invaluable in shaping this application.

Executive Summary
PharmaPrep NACOMS is an innovative, mobile-first platform designed to provide NACOMS pharmacy technician students with a comprehensive, interactive, and realistic tool to prepare for the National Pre-Certification Examination. The application addresses a critical gap in standardized exam preparation resources, enabling students to practice in a simulated environment that mirrors the structure, timing, and rigor of the official examination.
The platform enhances exam readiness, fosters consistent learning habits, provides detailed performance analytics, and identifies areas requiring improvement, ultimately contributing to higher student success rates and confidence levels.

Introduction and Background
Pharmacy Technician students face challenges in preparing effectively for the National Pre-Certification Examination due to limited access to standardized practice materials. Current resources are fragmented, inconsistent, or insufficiently aligned with exam requirements.
The proposed application bridges this gap by providing an all-encompassing solution tailored specifically to NACOMS Pharmacy Technician students. Leveraging modern educational technologies, the platform ensures that students can practice effectively, track progress, and engage in continuous, data-driven learning.

Objectives
The primary objectives of PharmaPrep NACOMS are:
1. Simulate the National Pre-Certification Examination with accuracy in format, timing, and question structure.
2. Provide a robust and regularly updated question bank covering all core pharmacy technician subjects.
3. Deliver immediate feedback and performance analytics, enabling students to identify strengths and weaknesses.
4. Encourage consistent practice through quizzes, practice modes, and offline access.
5. Create a scalable platform capable of expansion to other institutions and broader student populations.

Technical Architecture
Platform
• Mobile-first approach: Android initially, iOS planned for future release.
• Optional web interface for desktop access.
Technology Stack & Technical Specifications
Frontend (Client-Side / Mobile Application)
• Framework/Language: Python with Kivy for cross-platform mobile development (Android & iOS)
• UI/UX Design: KivyMD for Material Design components; Figma for prototyping
• Offline Support: SQLite local database integrated via Python’s sqlite3 module to allow offline practice
• State Management: Custom Python classes and modules for handling UI state and exam session data
• Animations & Interactivity: Kivy’s built-in Animation and ScreenManager modules
Backend (Server-Side)
• Framework/Language: Python with FastAPI for building RESTful APIs
• Authentication & Authorization: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access; OAuth 2.0 optional for future integration
• Data Validation: Pydantic models for structured request validation
• Caching: Redis for performance optimization of frequently requested questions and analytics
• Rate Limiting: Implemented at API gateway level using Python middleware
Database Layer
• Primary Database: PostgreSQL (cloud-hosted) for structured question and user data
• Alternative/Complementary: SQLite for offline caching and session storage
• Schema Design: Tables for Users, Exams, Questions, Results, Analytics; relational integrity enforced with foreign keys
• Backup Strategy: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
Analytics & Reporting
• Analytics Engine: Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for detailed performance metrics
• Visualization: Matplotlib / Seaborn for generating charts within the app; optional export to interactive dashboards
• Tracking: Tracks student progress, time-per-question, topic mastery, and exam trends
Security Measures
• Data Encryption: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
• Password Hashing: bcrypt with salt for secure storage
• Input Sanitization: Prevent SQL injection and other common vulnerabilities
• Compliance: Nigerian Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) and GDPR for potential international use
Deployment & DevOps
• Packaging / Distribution: Buildozer for packaging Kivy apps for Android; PyInstaller for desktop versions
• Containerization: Docker for backend services
• CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions for automated testing, builds, and deployment
• Hosting / Cloud: AWS EC2 for backend, S3 for static content, RDS for PostgreSQL database
• Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus & Grafana for metrics; ELK stack for logs
Version Control & Collaboration
• Git + GitHub repository for source code management
• Branching strategy: Gitflow with main, develop, feature branches
• Issue tracking via GitHub Issues / Project Boards
Testing Strategy
• Unit Testing: unittest / pytest for Python modules
• Integration Testing: FastAPI TestClient for API endpoints
• End-to-End Testing: Manual testing for Kivy UI; automated Python scripts where feasible
• Test Coverage: Minimum 80% code coverage target
